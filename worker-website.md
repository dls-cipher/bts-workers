# **Introduction**

Earlier this year, Cryptonomex and its President and Director, signed agreement with new appointed care-taker AP Asia Tech Co., LTD. Included in that agreement was handling the domain
and its related services, building and management of new website and its content (done by Richard Castro), and proper SEO services. Once AP Asia Tech Co., LTD was warned for non-profit status
requirement as owner of the domain, Milos Preocanin (DL) called his non-profit partner "Zavod Premik" from Slovenia and attached "Zavod Premik"
as current owner of the domain (based on partnership agreement from 2017). That disclosed, AP Asia Tech Co., LTD. will remain to be only technical partner of "Zavod Premik" in order to persuade 
best interests, top visibility and transparent results for domain bitshares.org(and it sub-domains) and content behind BitShares blockchain. 

# **Review of work done from March 2018 till September 2018**

- New CloudFlare Premium DNS Service
- New website with clean and corporate look available at http://demo.bitshares.org
- **14 New pages** with Content aligned by current/ongoing Core team publications/updates and new Whitepaper by BitShares Blockchain Foundation
- BTS Token Price ticker from CoinMarketCap
- Blockchain activity table fully integrated through api (using php 'include' to avoid err printing/crash visible on the website) - Courtesy/Collaboration of Estefan (blocktivity.info)
- Legal check of content for bitshares.org 
- Content SEO optimizations (targeted keywords, titles, metas)
- Readibility optimizations 
- Webalizer and AWStats enabled on demo domains (will be enabled for bitshares.org main website)
- Hosting SEO preparations/optimization - bitshares.org HOME ONLY 
- New BitShares GitHub repository for bitshares.org (where the future development will be available and current staging and production website)
- Email server with SPF record and SSL (Shared) protection - currently hosted with apasia.tech
- Separation of header and footer with php in order to get content updates less complicated
- Load Balancer main node (shared root between collaborators) with 3 nodes behind (Entire setup by APT - Asia, EU, USA) - "Zavod Premik" would be holding root to the USA, Bitshares Blockchain Foundation would be offered with EU, and Abit/Sigve would be offered to hold keys to Asia (Truly decentralized).
- DNS login restrictions between Fabian Schuh, Sigve Kvalsik and Milos Preocanin. 
- New 'Website Terms of Agreement' and 'Content Restrictions'

# **Worker Intent**

As seen from the demo, website is still missing content for DEX/Token Factory as Native dApps, CDN optimizations, proper code optimizations, CSS optimizations, and as any other website it will always have "room for improvements". 
Eco-system learned by now, that unmanaged website/domain can be very very damaging - re Brand, Marketing and Reputation (e.g. BitShares is not a DEX, BitShares is a Blockchain/Technology). After detailes analysis, reviews, legal advisory, 
opinions from other participants in our eco-system and some personal experience, we've selected a team of people that will for the following 12 months dedicate their best hours and skills to constantly keep improving bitshares.org in every possible way. 
The website and domain/hosting would be having General Roadmap for 12 months, with every 3 month presentations/review.
