# **Introduction**

Earlier this year, Cryptonomex and its President and Director, signed agreement with new appointed care-taker AP Asia Tech Co., LTD. Included in that agreement was handling the domain
and its related services, make-up and polishing of new website and its content done by Richard Castro, and proper SEO services. Once AP Asia Tech Co., LTD was warned for non-profit status
requirement for the owner of the domain, Milos Preocanin (DL) called his non-profit partner "Zavod Premik" from Slovenia (based on partnership agreement from 2017) and attached "Zavod Premik"
as current owner of the domain. 

# **Review of work done from March 2018 till September 2018**

- New CloudFlare Premium DNS Service
- New website with clean and corporate look available at http://demo.bitshares.org
- 14 New pages with Content aligned by current/ongoing Core team publications/updates and new Whitepaper by BitShares Blockchain Foundation
- BTS Price ticker from CMC
- Blocktivity.info table fully integrated through api (using php 'include' to avoid err printing on site) - Courtesy/Collaboration of Estefan
- Legal check on status of having DEX/Blockchain in Slovenia
- Legal check of content for bitshares.org
- Content SEO optimizations (targeted keywords, titles, metas)
- Hosting SEO preparations/optimization - bitshares.org ONLY
- New BitShares GitHub repository for bitshares.org (where the future development will be available and current staging and production website)
- Email server with SPF record and SSL (Shared) protection - currently hosted with apasia.tech
- Separation of header and footer with php in order to get content updates less complicated
- Load Balancer main node (shared root between collaborators) with 3 nodes behind (Entire setup by APT - Asia, EU, USA) - "Zavod Premik" would be holding root to the USA, Bitshares Blockchain Foundation would be offered with EU, and Abit/Sigve would be offered to hold keys to Asia (Truly decentralized).
- DNS login restrictions between Fabian Schuh, Sigve Kvalsik and Milos Preocanin. 
- New 'Website Terms of Agreement' and 'Content Restrictions'

# **Worker Intent**

As seen from the demo, website is still missing content for DEX/Token Factory as Native dApps, CDN optimizations, proper code optimizations, CSS optimizations, and as any other website it will always have "room for improvements". 
Eco-system learned by now, that unmanaged website/domain can be very very damaging - re Brand, Marketing and Reputation (e.g. BitShares is not a DEX, BitShares is a Blockchain/Technology). After detailes analysis, reviews, legal advisory, 
opinions from other participants in our eco-system and some personal experience, we've selected a team of people that will for the following 12 months dedicate their best hours and skills to constantly keep improving bitshares.org in every possible way. 
The website and domain/hosting would be having General Roadmap for 12 months, with every 3 month presentations/review.
