# **Who is Trusty(Introduction)**

We are Trusty team, business/product/technology specialists, willing to facilitate adoption of
BitShares blockchain by creating a bleeding edge app. Our passion is to offer to public a decentralized
exchange/wallet with top-notch UI/UX available across all mobile and web platforms. After research
we discovered that BitShares today is literally the only decentralized platform allowing such a bleeding
edge app to be developed and scaled globally. Existing 3rd party solutions, even native DEX UI doesn’t
unlock full potential of BitShares Blockchain (still with on-going development).

Another crucial reason we have chosen BitShares to be our blockchain-homeland is its incredible
community building up since 2014 (BitShares enjoys first mover advantage in the segment of
decentralized exchanges). Therefore, to prove our good will and integrity, we introduced ourselves by
contributing an open-source web framework for BitShares based on Vue . The web framework has
been tailored for BitShares to utilize it’s API calls and provide an intuitive SDK to create any kind of
decentralized applications on top of BitShares much easier and faster, than utilizing existing UI.

As a result we got a very positive feedback from the Community and it’s key members, especially from
Milos and APAsia.tech team. WOur collaboration with APAsia.tech has been very productive and
following our meeting in Thailand, we decided to unite our efforts for the growth and success of the
BitShares eco-system, where APAsia.tech would be our legal representative. This worker is our first public step forward.

# **Vision**

Drive BitShares Community Wallet to become a trustless-solution for both novice and experienced
crypto users to conveniently hold, trade and manage any types of crypto assets and accessible from
any mobile or web platform. 

# **Worker Intent**

We intend to release final version of BitShares Community Wallet in 6 months. Due to strong total amount of the worker, worker is by suggestion of Escrow split to 2 smaller instances of it (3 months each). This Worker will utilize most of
the BitShares features (API calls), intuitively accessible from a fully responsive web-app.
Launch of effective development process requires:

- Defining a collaboration framework between Trusty team (Contractor) and BitShares DAC
(client)
- Providing a transparent mechanism to regularly deliver results to the client
- Establishing a budget to sustain development
- Providing Community User-Friendly 100% Responsive wallet
- Support current UI Team and enable them to focus more on business development for DEX
and providing full API functionality while Community has a working product to be used
(Community Wallet)

## **Collaboration Framework**

We are using Git-based management system to ensure full transparency and accountability of the
project development. Below is the simple sequence of actions Trusty team will perform to deliver vest
results:

- List and continuously update development tasks on git, including tags of current status,
priority and sprint deadline
- Maintain timely communications with community members, posting issues or comments on
Git
- Favor feature usability (bugs fixing) over schedule and deliver the highest priority work first
- Deliver results for public beta testing by the end of every 3rd week (3 weeks sprints)
- Provide monthly reports of results against hours and costs of development
- Keep hours logged with TopTracker for entire team with reporting

## **Development Process**

We favor agile development process when all the workstreams (user journey, mockups, prototyping,
development, testing, documentation) are pushed simultaneously to release the highest priority
feature for public beta testing. Lean and interactive product development encourages faster user
feedback and ensures every new feature actually contributes to app usability. While designing trading
UI we will be using best market practice examples, Bitfinex and Huobi interfaces in particular.
