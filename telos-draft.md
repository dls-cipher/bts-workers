<h2>TELOS - A high profile fork by EOS block producers</h2>
<hr>
<p>It seems already in EOS short lifespan that a fork has come about. Of importance, is that it's by known and experienced block producers, expressing dissatisfication with the state of the network and proposing to build an entirely new blockchain to address a number of issues. One of which they have been claiming, is a potentially biased and 'whale controlled' monopoly on the top block producers. </p><p>Accusations exist, of the familiar spectacle of  'whales'; centralizing things just a little too much. Evidence is said to lay in how some new block producers, (paid blockchain nodes with the privelidge of keeping a portion of tokens they 'mint') - apparantly, they say, when looked into, have no credentials, infrastructure, or reason why average participants/holders of EOS tokens would vote for them. Yet they seem to have gained the votes anyway. </p><p> Let's take a look at facts, and please, we'd love it if you add you're own 'two cents' of thought  in the comments :-) </p>

<h3>Everyone is talking about TELOS. Below, Aug 23, 2018 - just take a look at the result from a Google search of <em>"EOS FORK"</em> It's all TELOS.</h3>

<h3>Blockchain Project Review 3?</h3>
<p>Accidentaly, but for a reason ... </p>
<h5>Putting this together, we found it would be easist to follow are recently introduced review format</h5>
<p>In doing so, it gave up almost everything we needed to know about TELOS. As you shall see, it is seems like a team with knowledge and integrity, with the added advantage of an existing, passionate community with tools and skills to hit the ground running. More than that, of course the world is looking - this has to be a highly motivated and serious community or it's nothing - taking a path down a new road to what they commited perhaps 2 years ago already. Without further ado, we just bring you all the links and screenshots we took, with commentary.</p>

<h4>From the Press Release:</h4> 
<em><q>The Telos Network, a joint project by experienced members of the EOS block producer community, is launching the first sustainably decentralized new blockchain based on EOSIO software</q></em>

<h3>Website Quality Checks</h3>
<hr>
<p>Familiar from past reviews, the tools available on gtmetrix.com and seositecheckup.com provide a rapid impression of overall technical skill, quality, thought to detail and effort in general. Finally, we will try to share some of the errors and things to be fixed.</p>

<p>Here used just for a quick impression, however the news is good and the website has been well put together. We will just touch on a few things for polishing to get over the 'PASS' level.</p>

<center><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmbrJcNDiRmyi8RwVGhWHAkTFcyW1b5ERf6TDKVAfSJk37/gtmetrix-score.jpg">GTMetrix.com</center>
<hr>

<p>The score above has room for improvement, one primary issue is http is still open in spite of SSL being configured, so there is a domain/SSL config issue we spotted and would hope can easily be resolved as otherwise the website is still not as secure as desirable.</p>
<hr>
<center><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmYeBxMKvuZru3CksoYn7iMMzpbXbG2BWP5u7xmDLGdhx9/SSL-Non-Secure-Open.png"><br><sup>SSL needs checking</sup></center>

<hr>
<p>Standout in simplicity is the footer design. It packs a nice punch with links to the social media and communities. Only one improvement we'd make would be not to publish the email address, as this will get spammed, and implement a secure contact form instead. </p>

<h4>Fixes Required on the website telosfoundation.io</h4>
<center>
<p>Sorry to tell you TELOS, the following stuff really has to be polished up, it's for your own good only!</p>

<h3>Whitepaper</h3>
<p>Next we delve into the whitepaper. First we find it to be highly presentable, with roadmap version markers throughout.</p>
<center><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmUm6hYjN7Q9tRW6ia4ZvwNhupbynuPjVUZshLg8bhsGMa/telos-whitepaper-1.png"><sup><a href="http://resources.telosfoundation.io/telos_white_paper_8_15_18.pdf">whitepaper</a></sup></center>
<hr>

<a href="http://resources.telosfoundation.io/telos_white_paper_8_15_18.pdf"><h4>Read the whitepaper here</h4></a>
<br>
<p>Starting with the table of contents as always, it is clear the paper wastes no time in beating around the bush, assumes the reader is partially familiar with EOS and gets to the meat of the topic and stays specific to it.</p>

<center><img src="https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmQvMMTz9JCVnnn7Uwmtrd7FwwkekMockjXSpnvoPvk2oy/telos-wp-toc.jpg"></center>

<p>Highlight from the whitepaper, we marked in green 2 particular rules we liked and feel could even be well argued for and applied to #BitShares someday ... just a thought (!)</p>

<hr>
<p>The main whitepaper criticism, and polishing act that could happen in a future revision - is to make more of an identity, to not be so concerned of the percieved or real EOS problems and using that as the main fuel - and just get on with building a vision. Without sounding too biased and really trying to stay objective, the author (@britcoins) feels TELOS would hope to stand without the shadow of EOS over it.</p>

<h5>Which brings us to GitHub</h5>
<a href="https://github.com/Telos-Foundation/telos"><h4>TELOS Foundation GitHub</h4></a>
<hr>
<p>What would any poke around a project be without it. Plenty was found on the TELOS GitHub account, for those hungry to find out more than this humble article reveals. The stats appear to show us a very active repository indeed, whilst sticking to strict MIT open-source license terms:</p>

<h4>Supplement - TELOS first Medium article</h4>

<h3>Some key facts ...</h3>
<p>TELOS says they'll banish whales by giving a 1-1 drop on EOS holders, but it will be capped at 40k tokens per account</p> 

<p>The few that created the chain and become original BPs, get 1 million tokens each …. There were some questions about that, and as such apparantely now these will be vested over 3 years and will not be useable for voting stake. Feedback has been rife and it would seem they are paying attention to it. Do you have an opinion on it? Let us know in the comments -  is it important for these few founders to have a strong stake, and reward, will it keep them honest? Or is it too much of a danger they'll always retain too much influence?</p>
<hr>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>There is no denying this is a very intersting deveopment in the crypto-space. We're keen to see where this goes, and can't see a harm in it - done legit, and by a solid team. Whatever happens it will pose some challenge to BlockOne/EOS and perhaps in that sense they'll need to respond. </p>
