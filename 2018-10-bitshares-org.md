# **Introduction**

The initiative is a clear path to an updated, optimized and professionally managed BitShares.org domain/website that will provide a professional and corporate experience to our visitors, clients and on-boarding businesses. In order to achieve that, the website will follow certain standards and active trends in order to gain top visibility and maintain online presence. First steps will involve pro-bono initial boosts to gain traffic. Zavod Premik and the worker manager are taking all legal responsibility and obligation towards the domain BitShares.org, its sub-domains and content/marketing that are being presented and related to it.

The community and eco-system have learned by now, that an unmanaged website/domain can be very damaging - re Brand, Marketing and Reputation (e.g. BitShares is not a DEX, BitShares is a Blockchain/Technology). After detailed analysis, reviews, legal advisory, opinions from other participants in our eco-system and professional experience, we've selected a team of people that will for the following 12 months dedicate their best hours and skills to constantly improve and enhance the BitShares.org website/online business presentation and support in every possible way. 

# **Worker Intent**

From community, excellent resources have emerged - for example, in coming up with a redesigned website and continuing with it alongside team members listed in this worker until now. However, it is not enough benefit or value to the shareholders and community, to merely place a new website online. Fundamental, is the ongoing management and running of the BitShares.Org web property this worker also specifically addresses to ensure an active, continual uplift in overall BitShares online presence, marketing and organic eco-system/community growth. The worker will ensure the community can source the best possible resources and expertise around it, and better represent BitShares to the general public, industry, and beyond. 

As seen from the demo, website is still missing: content for 2 new pages (DEX + Token Factory as Native dApps), CDN optimizations, final code optimizations, CSS optimizations, and as with any website; there will always be “room for improvement". A general 3 months Roadmap is included. The website and domain/hosting will maintain such a Roadmap for 12 months, with presentation and review similar to the below every 3 months.

# **History**

Earlier in 2018, Cryptonomex and its President and Director, signed an agreement whereby AP Asia Tech Co., LTD. 
would become the newly appointed care-taker of the BitShares.Org domain/web property. Included in the agreement was 
handling the domain and its related services, building and management of a new website and content (done by Richard Castro), 
and proper SEO services. 

AP Asia Tech Co., LTD was advised by the community that the domain should be owned by a non-profit entity. 
Milos Preocanin (Digital Lucifer) took the initiative and called on his non-profit partner 
["Zavod Premik" from Slovenia](move-institute.si) to be the owner of the domain. "Zavod Premik" aka the Move Institute 
is already active in the BitShares economy, e.g. 
 - [Zavod Premik – ‘Move’ Institute: Expansion to BitShares Foundations](https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?topic=26639.0)
 - [Existing partnership agreement with APAsia from 2017](http://apasia.tech/downloads/docs/Agreement-Non-Profit-Inst-Zavod-Premnik-Nov2017.pdf) 
 
That disclosed, AP Asia Tech Co., LTD. will remain as a technical partner of "Zavod Premik” in order to
pursue best interests, top visibility and transparent results for the domain BitShares.org (and it sub-domains) 
and the underlying content.

## **BitShares GitHub Repository**

The content of the new BitShares.org website will be publicly hosted on github with an automatic deployment pipeline to 
the actual domain.
